Hi, I am a Cloud Solutions Architect by trade - and a nerd at heart. I've spent the last 21 years in coding, architecture design, consulting and tinkering across the technology stack - from infrastructure to applications at scale. I enjoy creating solutions and implementing scalable and reusable architectured to drive cost-effective solutions to real world business challenges.

I am currently an Azure Solutions Architect on the SouthWest team at Microsoft where I get a chance to work with some great clients and use the latest technologies to solve real business problems. More about my career can be found on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/sadakubsad).

This blog, is my chance to finally share many of my own learnings and ideas publicly. If I find a solution that I feel is cool, I'm going to fire up my blog, write about the problem and tell you what I did to solve it. Eventually, readers will come. This blog is entirely my personal project and my opnions and have nothing to do with my employer.
